01-flanger.py - Hand-made simple flanger.

A flanger is an audio effect produced by mixing two identical signals
together, one signal delayed by a small and gradually changing period.
This produces a swept comb filter effect: peaks and notches are produced
in the resulting frequency spectrum, related to each other in a linear
harmonic series. Varying the time delay causes these to sweep up and
down the frequency spectrum.
